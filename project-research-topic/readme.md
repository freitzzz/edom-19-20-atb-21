# EDOM - Project Research Topic

In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed for the investigative topic of the project.

There is only one folder for this task because it is a team task and, as such, usually there will be no need to create individual folders.

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.

## MoDisco

### What is MoDisco ?

MoDisco (Model Discovery) is a generic, extensible and global *MDRE* approach that provides a ready-to-use framework implemented on top of the Eclipse Platform as an official Eclipse Project [1].
It aims at supporting the reverse engineering of IT legacy systems which are to be updated by new developers who don't know its architecture.
Being a fully open source framework that relies only on generic components and thus providing extensibility for new technologies support, MoDisco differentiates from other MDRE technologies as these are built with specific language parsers, grammars and metamodels that are licensed as properietary. One of the biggest issues when working with legacy systems for organizations is the financial costs that it brings (passar esta parte dos custos para benefits of MoDisco)

### What is MDRE ?

MDRE (Model Driven Reverse Engineering) is the process of applying MDE (Model Driven Engineering) principles and techniques to reverse engineering in order to generate relevant model-based views of a system whose architecture is unknown (e.g. legacy systems). Reverse Engineering in software is the process of recreating the design of the software based on its artifacts (executables, code, documentation) [2].
It differs from *forward engineering* in the sense that forward engineering intends to use software design to create software implementations. MDRE aims to build and use models from the system implementation (using MDE), creating high-level views such as domain and object models, in order to improve maintenance and evolution processes [1].
Thus it is possible to benefit from MDRE in MDSE (Model Driven Software Evolution) processes.
As an example, imagine that a consulting company hires a team of developers to maintain a really old software (legacy system) that has no documentation, doesn't follow common language conventions and does not apply any design patterns. At first this might look like an impossible job, yet if the team applies MDRE processes, it will be able to generate proper views of the software, which will be useful to analyze this one and to mark a starting point of the maintenance.
