# EDOM - Project Research Topic

In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed for the investigative topic of the project.

There is only one folder for this task because it is a team task and, as such, usually there will be no need to create individual folders.

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.
