# EDOM - Project Research Topic

In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed for the investigative topic of the project.

There is only one folder for this task because it is a team task and, as such, usually there will be no need to create individual folders.

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.

## MoDisco

### What is MoDisco ?

MoDisco (Model Discovery) is a generic, extensible and global *MDRE* approach that provides a ready-to-use framework implemented on top of the Eclipse Platform as an official Eclipse Project [1].
It aims at supporting the reverse engineering of IT legacy systems which are to be updated by new developers who don't know its architecture.
Being a fully open source framework that relies only on generic components and thus providing extensibility for new technologies support, MoDisco differentiates from other MDRE technologies as these are built with specific language parsers, grammars and metamodels that are licensed as properietary. One of the biggest issues when working with legacy systems for organizations is the financial costs that it brings (passar esta parte dos custos para benefits of MoDisco)
