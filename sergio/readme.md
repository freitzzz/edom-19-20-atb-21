# EDOM - Project Increments


In this folder you should add **all** artifacts developed in project of the EDOM course.

### Structure of Folders

There should be a subfolder for each project increment. For instance, subfolder "increment1" will contain all the artifacts for increment 1 of EDOM project; subfolder "increment2" will contain all the artifacts for increment 2 of the EDOM project; etc.  

**Note:** If for some reason you need to bypass these guidelines please ask for directions with your teacher and **always** state the exceptions in your commits and issues in bitbucket.
